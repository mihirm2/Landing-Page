							<h1 class="major">Research Journey</h1>
							<p>My academic journey is marked by a series of intriguing research projects that have allowed me to dive deep into various domains:</p>

							<h3>Financial Mathematics: Option Pricing</h3>
								<p>My exploration into the Black-Scholes model has been both challenging and rewarding. I've investigated how this higher-order partial differential equation can be applied to determine the fair price of Indian stock options. This journey not only enhanced my understanding of complex financial instruments but also underscored the model's applicability in diverse markets.</p>
								
							<h3>Statistics in Football</h3>
								<p>Football, a game of passion and strategy, became my research playground as I analyzed how statistical data can influence game strategies and evaluations. Through primary research and interaction with licensed football coaches in Mumbai, I gathered valuable insights that reinforced the critical role of data in sports.</p>
								
							<h3>Hypertext Web Search Engines</h3>
								<p>The world of web search engines is vast and fascinating. My ongoing investigation into large-scale hypertext web search engines focuses on the technical challenges and innovative solutions needed to enhance search results. This project has deepened my appreciation for the complexity and potential of web technologies.</p>
